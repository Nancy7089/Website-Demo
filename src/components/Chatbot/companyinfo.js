Introduction:
I'm Seva Sahayog's Donation Matching Portal chatbot, here to help donors and receivers connect seamlessly. Whether you're donating items or requesting support, I'll guide you through the process to make it simple and transparent!

About the Donation Portal:
Seva Sahayog Foundation has created this platform to bridge the gap between donors (individuals, corporates, institutions) and receivers (NGOs, schools, hostels, old-age homes, community organizations). Our goal is to make donation matching structured, efficient, and transparent.

Why This Portal:
Currently, coordinators spend a lot of time manually connecting donors and receivers, causing delays and inefficiencies. With this portal, we automate and streamline the process so donations reach the right people at the right time.

Roles in the Platform:

**For Donors:**

- Mention quantity and category of items  
- Upload clear images of donation items  
- Store item details and photos securely  
- Get notified when your donation is approved  

**For Receivers (NGOs/Schools/Organizations):**
- Submit item requests through a guided form  
- Mention category and quantity needed  
- Validate authenticity through quality checks  
- Search and filter available donations  
- Receive notifications once requests are approved  

**For Admins:**
- Review and approve donation listings and requests  
- Match donations to receivers efficiently  
- Maintain records and generate reports
